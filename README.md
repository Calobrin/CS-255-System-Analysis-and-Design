#Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DrivePass project was to create an app to allow people to take driving tests and driving lessons to get their lisence. The client was Liam, the owner of Driverpass. The system they wanted was simply a web-based app (either computer or Mobile device accesible) to be able to login and register appointments as well as specific packages for how many driving lessons there would be with different drivers, all for the goal of passing their driving tests.

#What did you do particularly well?

I think I did the UML diagrams well, or at least it was what I enjoyed creating the most. I already had some experience with UML diagrams so it almost came as second nature to create them with proper formatting. 

#If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

Functional and non-functional requirements are still a bit hazy to me and if I had to I would try to revise these areas. I need more experience with these things and truly understanding what exactly is a functional, and what is exactly is non functional. I would improve it by expanding upon what I have and determining what was correct and what needs to be removed and replaced.

#How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I was very careful to pay attention to the users needs, because it is the most important. Since we are creating this project FOR the user, so I would see no reason to disregard their needs. I made sure to get everything they had mentioned as part of the design, such as the ability for the owner to be able to download all data for managing it in excel for example. I included ways for the data of appointment reservervations to be stored so the owner would have that available for download.

#How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

This is a tough question to answer, I think I mostly try to understand what the system will need to do, or what is desired from it, and then I think of how that can be achieved. And usually when it comes to things like this, I think there are often multiple ways to go about solving the same problem, so it really relies on the creativity and understanding of the person or team designing it. Having more experience with this will clearly help, and some aspects of the design may become second nature and muscle memory where you barely need to think about what it is you are doing, you simply get it done.
